    <p>
        Meleket School capitalizes on each child’s individual strengths through an integrated multiple intelligences
        (MI) curriculum. Inspired by MI theory, we believe a rich environment with a verity of experiences enables our
        children to grow physically, emotionally, intellectually and socially. Thus, a balance of activities involving
        structured outdoors and indoors play, exploration learning will be provided. Besides, our curriculum includes
        small and large group participation as well as one to one interaction with teachers, whether planned or
        spontaneous that foster development of our child as an individual-confident, joyful learner, who is successful
        academically, knowledgeable about her/himself and others and who values diversity. The program is, therefore, is
        “not one size fits all” approach. In cognizant of the above we developed the following programs.
